BUILD / RUN
===========

  1) build lib in "cpp/"
  2) eql test.lisp



NOTES / SUGGESTIONS
===================

This is meant to offer an easy way to dynamically integrate Qt/C++ code.

Of course this could be extended to use all functionality of "Qt_EQL" (calling
Lisp from C++, adding Qt properties, signals, slots...).

A very nice feature to have would be automatic reloading of a re-compiled C++
library (using QFileSystemWatcher), in order to have a really dynamic workflow,
even for C++ extensions.

So: to be continued...
