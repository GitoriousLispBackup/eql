REBUILD STEPS
=============

Change to eql/src/ and do:

1) remove the directory tmp/

2) ecl -shell make-eql-lib.lisp

3) qmake, make (MSVC: nmake) in this order:

    eql_lib.pro
    eql_exe.pro

    module_network.pro
    module_...



IMPORTANT NOTE
==============

You always need to rebuild from any "*.pro" file (e.g. the EQL modules,
Qt_EQL) after upgrading EQL.

The simplest way to clean everything is to remove the whole "tmp/" directory in
the respective build directory, since the Makefile generated by Qt not always
works correctly with "make clean" (e.g. on Windows).
